<Card title="What is Fundamental Analysis?" icon="magnifying-glass" color="#6b7280">
  Fundamental analysis is the cornerstone of intelligent investing - evaluating a company's intrinsic value by examining its financial health, business model, competitive position, and growth prospects to make informed investment decisions.
</Card>

## Why Fundamental Analysis Matters

Fundamental analysis helps you answer the most important investment question: "Is this company's stock price justified by its underlying business value?" This approach has made legendary investors like Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, and Benjamin Graham incredibly wealthy.

### The Investment Philosophy

**Value vs. Price**: Price is what you pay, value is what you get. Fundamental analysis helps you identify when a stock's price is significantly different from its intrinsic value.

**Long-term Perspective**: While stock prices fluctuate wildly in the short term, they tend to reflect business fundamentals over longer periods.

**Competitive Advantage**: The best investments are companies with sustainable competitive advantages (moats) that protect their profits from competition.

### What Fundamental Analysis Reveals

- **Financial Health**: Is the company profitable and growing?
- **Business Quality**: Does it have competitive advantages?
- **Management Quality**: Are executives making smart decisions?
- **Valuation**: Is the stock cheap, fair, or expensive?
- **Growth Prospects**: What's the potential for future expansion?

## The Three Essential Financial Statements

Understanding financial statements is like learning to read - it's essential for investment success. Every public company publishes these quarterly and annually.

### Understanding the Income Statement

The income statement tells the story of a company's profitability over a specific period. Think of it as a report card for how well management converted sales into profits.

**Revenue (Top Line)**: Total money coming in from sales
- **Quality Check**: Is revenue growing consistently? Is growth from new customers or higher prices?
- **Red Flags**: Declining revenue, heavy dependence on one customer, one-time revenue boosts

**Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Direct costs to produce products/services
- **Analysis**: Lower COGS as % of revenue suggests improving efficiency or pricing power
- **Benchmark**: Compare COGS margins to industry competitors

**Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS**
- **Interpretation**: Higher gross margins indicate pricing power and competitive advantages
- **Example**: Apple's ~38% gross margins vs. Dell's ~23% shows Apple's premium pricing ability

**Operating Expenses**: Costs to run the business (R&D, marketing, administration)
- **Growth Phase**: High R&D spending can indicate future growth investment
- **Mature Phase**: Operating leverage should improve margins as revenue grows

**Net Income (Bottom Line)**: Final profit after all expenses and taxes
- **Growth Pattern**: Look for consistent growth over multiple years
- **Quality**: Prefer companies that grow earnings faster than revenue (improving margins)

### Valuation Ratios

<Steps>
  <Step title="Price-to-Earnings (P/E)">
    **Formula**: Stock Price ÷ Earnings Per Share

    **Interpretation**:
    - Low P/E: Potentially undervalued or slow growth
    - High P/E: Growth expectations or overvaluation
    - Compare to industry average and historical P/E
  </Step>

    **Formula**: Stock Price ÷ Book Value Per Share

    **Use Cases**:
    - Value investing screening
    - Asset-heavy industries
    - P/B < 1 may indicate undervaluation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Price-to-Sales (P/S)">
    **Formula**: Market Cap ÷ Annual Revenue

## Valuation Methods

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

```python
# Simplified DCF Model
def dcf_valuation(free_cash_flows, terminal_growth, discount_rate):
    """
    Calculate intrinsic value using DCF method
    """
    present_values = []

    # Discount projected cash flows
    for year, fcf in enumerate(free_cash_flows, 1):
        pv = fcf / (1 + discount_rate) ** year
        present_values.append(pv)

    # Terminal value
    terminal_fcf = free_cash_flows[-1] * (1 + terminal_growth)
    terminal_value = terminal_fcf / (discount_rate - terminal_growth)
    terminal_pv = terminal_value / (1 + discount_rate) ** len(free_cash_flows)

    # Total enterprise value
    enterprise_value = sum(present_values) + terminal_pv

    return enterprise_value

# Example calculation
projected_fcf = [100, 110, 121, 133, 146]  # 5-year projections
terminal_growth = 0.03  # 3% perpetual growth
discount_rate = 0.10    # 10% WACC

intrinsic_value = dcf_valuation(projected_fcf, terminal_growth, discount_rate)
```

### Comparable Company Analysis

<Accordion title="Trading Multiples Method">
  **Process**:
  1. Identify comparable companies (same industry, size, business model)
  2. Calculate key multiples (P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/S)
  3. Apply median/average multiples to target company
  4. Derive implied valuation range

  **Example**:
  ```
  Comparable P/E ratios: 15x, 18x, 22x, 16x, 20x
  Median P/E: 18x
  Target EPS: $5.00
  Implied Value: 18 × $5.00 = $90 per share
  ```
</Accordion>
