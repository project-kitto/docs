## The Three Financial Statements

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Income Statement">
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <Info>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Liquidity Ratios

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Current Ratio">
    ```javascript
    // Current Ratio Formula
    const currentRatio = currentAssets / currentLiabilities;

    // Interpretation
    if (currentRatio > 2) {
      console.log("Strong liquidity, may have excess cash");
    } else if (currentRatio >= 1.5) {
      console.log("Good liquidity position");
    } else if (currentRatio >= 1) {
      console.log("Adequate liquidity, monitor closely");
    } else {
      console.log("Potential liquidity concerns");
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Quick Ratio">
    ```javascript
    // Quick Ratio (Acid Test)
    const quickRatio = (currentAssets - inventory) / currentLiabilities;

    // More conservative than current ratio
    // Excludes inventory (harder to convert to cash)

    const interpretation = {
      excellent: quickRatio >= 1.5,
      good: quickRatio >= 1.0,
      concerning: quickRatio < 1.0
    };
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Valuation Ratios

<Steps>
  <Step title="Price-to-Earnings (P/E)">
    **Formula**: Stock Price ÷ Earnings Per Share

    **Interpretation**:
    - Low P/E: Potentially undervalued or slow growth
    - High P/E: Growth expectations or overvaluation
    - Compare to industry average and historical P/E
  </Step>

  <Step title="Price-to-Book (P/B)">
    **Formula**: Stock Price ÷ Book Value Per Share

    **Use Cases**:
    - Value investing screening
    - Asset-heavy industries
    - P/B < 1 may indicate undervaluation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Price-to-Sales (P/S)">
    **Formula**: Market Cap ÷ Annual Revenue

    **Benefits**:
    - Useful for unprofitable companies
    - Less manipulable than earnings
    - Good for growth companies
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Valuation Methods

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

```python
# Simplified DCF Model
def dcf_valuation(free_cash_flows, terminal_growth, discount_rate):
    """
    Calculate intrinsic value using DCF method
    """
    present_values = []

    # Discount projected cash flows
    for year, fcf in enumerate(free_cash_flows, 1):
        pv = fcf / (1 + discount_rate) ** year
        present_values.append(pv)

    # Terminal value
    terminal_fcf = free_cash_flows[-1] * (1 + terminal_growth)
    terminal_value = terminal_fcf / (discount_rate - terminal_growth)
    terminal_pv = terminal_value / (1 + discount_rate) ** len(free_cash_flows)

    # Total enterprise value
    enterprise_value = sum(present_values) + terminal_pv

    return enterprise_value

# Example calculation
projected_fcf = [100, 110, 121, 133, 146]  # 5-year projections
terminal_growth = 0.03  # 3% perpetual growth
discount_rate = 0.10    # 10% WACC

intrinsic_value = dcf_valuation(projected_fcf, terminal_growth, discount_rate)
```

### Comparable Company Analysis

<Accordion title="Trading Multiples Method">
  **Process**:
  1. Identify comparable companies (same industry, size, business model)
  2. Calculate key multiples (P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/S)
  3. Apply median/average multiples to target company
  4. Derive implied valuation range

  **Example**:
  ```
  Comparable P/E ratios: 15x, 18x, 22x, 16x, 20x
  Median P/E: 18x
  Target EPS: $5.00
  Implied Value: 18 × $5.00 = $90 per share
  ```
</Accordion>
